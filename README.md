John Vargas Beltrán's original description:

> Germania One is a hybrid between two historical and functional concepts found
> in German typography, the old fraktur and the simplified geometric sans serif
> forms from the Bauhaus. I sought to create a new font that mixes these two
> styles to provide a new and original typeface. Something modern and at the
> same time old, reworking the geometric forms in a contemporary and expressive
> way.

I wanted a full set of variants for a project and thought they might be useful
to other people as well. Happy to accept further fixes/modifications!
